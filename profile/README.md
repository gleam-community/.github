The gleam-community organisation seeks to provide **high-quality**,
**authoritative** packages for the wider [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) community to use. These packages
are typically beyond the scope of—or not a good fit for—the official [Gleam
organisation](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam), but would still benefit from having a single high-quality
implementation.

If you'd like to learn more about the effort (like who's in charge, or how to participate),
you can find more details in the [gleam-community/META](https://github.com/gleam-community/META)
repository.
